Carl_R._de_Boor,"Carl-Wilhelm Reinhold de Boor (born 3 December 1937) is a German-American mathematician and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Born in Stolp, Germany (now, as part of Poland, called Słupsk), as the seventh of eight children born to Werner (an anti-Nazi Lutheran minister) and Toni de Boor in 1937, he fled in 1945 with his family, settling eventually in Schwerin, then part of East Germany. As a child, he was often ill, suffering from a variety of conditions. In 1955, young Carl took advantage of the temporary political thaw following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, obtained a one-month visa to West Germany and biked there, then decided to stay when he learned there that his application to Humboldt University (in East Berlin) for the study of chemistry had been turned down (because of his poor performance in mathematics). However, Otto Friedrich (a brother of Carl's father's first wife) was willing and able to help him.","carl-wilhelm reinhold de boor ( born 3 december 1937 ) german-american mathematician professor emeritus university wisconsin–madison . born stolp , germany ( , part poland , called słupsk ) , seventh eight children born werner ( anti-nazi lutheran minister ) toni de boor 1937 , fled 1945 family , settling eventually schwerin , part east germany . child , often ill , suffering variety conditions . 1955 , young carl took advantage temporary political thaw following joseph stalin 's death 1953 , obtained one-month visa west germany biked , decided stay learned application humboldt university ( east berlin ) study chemistry turned ( poor performance mathematics ) . however , otto friedrich ( brother carl 's father 's first wife ) willing able help .",American mathematician,american mathematician,Z,mathematician
